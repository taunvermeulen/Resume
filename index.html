          <li>Marketing of new business</li>
          <li>Surf Coach</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>In instructing surf lessons, I have been exposed to many pressure-filled scenarios whereby I had to remain calm and handle the situation professionally. From this, I have learnt a key skill in working under pressure, therefore allowing me to reach timeously deadlines with ease and efficiency, without effecting the quality of my workmanship.</p>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>While completing my marketing degree and working at SurfEnds, I worked as a warehouse manager at Tean Distributions.

        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Teaching English to people who do not know the English Language can be challenging.

In future circumstances, I can successfully communicate with my team.</p>
